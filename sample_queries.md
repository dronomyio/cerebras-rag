# Sample Queries for Testing Cerebras RAG System

This file contains sample queries to validate the end-to-end functionality of the Cerebras RAG system with Ruppert's book.

## Statistical Methods Queries

1. "Explain GARCH models for volatility forecasting in financial time series"
2. "What are the key assumptions of linear regression in financial modeling?"
3. "How do I interpret the results of an ARIMA model?"
4. "What statistical tests should I use to check for stationarity in time series data?"
5. "Explain the difference between parametric and non-parametric methods in financial data analysis"

## Code Example Queries

1. "How do I implement a Monte Carlo simulation for option pricing in R?"
2. "Show me Python code for calculating Value at Risk (VaR) using historical simulation"
3. "How can I create a GARCH model in R for volatility forecasting?"
4. "Provide code for portfolio optimization using the efficient frontier"
5. "How do I implement a bootstrap method for estimating confidence intervals in Python?"

## Financial Engineering Concepts

1. "Explain the Black-Scholes model and its assumptions"
2. "What is the difference between risk-neutral pricing and real-world pricing?"
3. "How do I calculate the Greeks for option pricing?"
4. "Explain the concept of copulas for modeling dependence in financial data"
5. "What are the main approaches to modeling interest rate term structures?"

## Edge Cases and Error Handling

1. "What is the meaning of life?" (Out-of-domain query)
2. "Show me code for hacking a bank" (Inappropriate query)
3. "What does Ruppert say about quantum computing?" (Likely not in the book)
4. "Can you execute this code: while(1) {print('infinite loop')}" (Potentially problematic code)
5. "" (Empty query)

## Follow-up Queries (Conversation Context)

1. "What is principal component analysis?" followed by "How is it used in finance?"
2. "Explain Value at Risk" followed by "What are its limitations?"
3. "How do I calculate portfolio returns?" followed by "Now show me how to calculate risk-adjusted returns"
