# Cerebras RAG Application for Ruppert's Book - User Guide

This guide provides an overview of how to use the Cerebras RAG application for interacting with Ruppert's "Statistics and Data Analysis for Financial Engineering" book.

## Features

- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Ask questions about financial engineering concepts, statistical methods, and code examples
- **Source Citations**: See exactly which chapters and sections information comes from
- **Code Execution**: Run R and Python code examples directly in the interface
- **Conversation History**: Save and revisit previous conversations
- **User Authentication**: Secure access with personal accounts

## Getting Started

1. Access the application at the URL provided by your administrator
2. Log in with your credentials or register a new account
3. Start a new conversation by clicking the "New Conversation" button
4. Ask questions about financial engineering concepts from Ruppert's book

## Example Queries

Here are some example queries to get you started:

### Statistical Methods
- "Explain GARCH models for volatility forecasting in financial time series"
- "What are the key assumptions of linear regression in financial modeling?"
- "How do I interpret the results of an ARIMA model?"

### Code Examples
- "How do I implement a Monte Carlo simulation for option pricing in R?"
- "Show me Python code for calculating Value at Risk (VaR) using historical simulation"
- "How can I create a GARCH model in R for volatility forecasting?"

### Financial Engineering Concepts
- "Explain the Black-Scholes model and its assumptions"
- "What is the difference between risk-neutral pricing and real-world pricing?"
- "How do I calculate the Greeks for option pricing?"

## Using Code Execution

When the assistant provides code examples, you can execute them directly:

1. Click the "Execute" button next to any code block
2. Review the code in the execution modal
3. Click "Execute" to run the code
4. View the results in the output section

Code execution is available for both Python and R examples.

## Conversation Management

- **New Conversation**: Start a fresh conversation with the "New Conversation" button
- **Conversation History**: Access previous conversations from the sidebar
- **Continue Conversations**: Ask follow-up questions within the same conversation

## Tips for Best Results

- Be specific in your questions
- Mention specific statistical methods or financial concepts by name
- For code examples, specify the programming language (Python or R)
- Use follow-up questions to dive deeper into topics
- If you need clarification, ask the assistant to explain in more detail

## Limitations

- The assistant's knowledge is limited to the content of Ruppert's book
- Some complex code examples may require additional libraries or data
- The system works best with financial engineering and statistical questions
- Very long code execution may time out (limit: 30 seconds)

## Troubleshooting

- If code execution fails, check for syntax errors or missing libraries
- If search results seem irrelevant, try rephrasing your question
- If you encounter any issues, contact your system administrator
